# Learning MCP Notes - Model Context Protocol

This post contains my learning notes about the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a powerful protocol for connecting AI models with external tools and resources.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI models to securely connect to and interact with various tools, data sources, and resources. It provides a standardized way for AI models to access external capabilities while maintaining proper security boundaries.

## Key Concepts

### Servers and Clients
- **MCP Servers**: Provide tools and resources to AI models
- **MCP Clients**: Connect to servers and facilitate communication with AI models

### Protocol Components
- **Tools**: Functions that models can invoke to perform actions
- **Resources**: Data sources that models can read from
- **Prompts**: Reusable prompt templates for common tasks

## Getting Started

TODO: Add notes on:
- Setting up MCP development environment
- Creating basic MCP servers
- Implementing common tools and resources
- Security considerations
- Best practices

## Use Cases

Some potential applications of MCP include:
- File system access for AI models
- Database connectivity
- API integrations
- Custom tool development
- Enterprise system integration

## Resources

- [MCP Official Repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
- [MCP Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
- Community examples and tutorials

## Notes in Progress

This is a placeholder post for collecting my learning notes as I explore MCP. I'll be updating this with:

- Hands-on examples
- Code snippets
- Best practices
- Common patterns
- Troubleshooting tips

Stay tuned for updates as I dive deeper into the Model Context Protocol!
