*Updated December 2025*

### Current Revenue Numbers

| Project | Monthly Revenue | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| **Photo AI** | ~$155,000 | >$1.8M ARR, flagship AI product |
| **Interior AI** | ~$50,000 | Steady performer |

- **Peak concurrent players**: 17,000
- **Monetization**: In-game ads + aircraft purchases

- Google's **TPU (tensor processing unit)** hardware advances
- Belief that "hardware is the end game" for AI dominance
- Views Google as positioned to compete with xAI and Chinese AI companies

### Key 2025 Insights

1. **AI-first development**: Now building products faster than ever using Cursor AI
2. **Diversified income**: Expanded beyond SaaS into games and strategic investments
3. **Continued transparency**: Still publicly sharing revenue numbers on X/Twitter
