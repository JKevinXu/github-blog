### 6. **Spaces & Chat Agents**

**Spaces:**
- Personal or team workspaces with specific context
- Upload files, connect datasets
- Maintain access permissions
- Scale from personal to enterprise-wide

**Chat Agents:**
- Built-in insights agent for general queries
- Custom agents for specific departments (sales, compliance, HR)
- Configured with business context and expertise

---

### Architecture: Account-Level vs Application Instances

**Important Distinction:**

**Quick Suite Architecture:**
- ❌ **No "application instance" concept**
- **Account-level service** - One Quick Suite per AWS account
- Organization through **Spaces** (workspaces) and **custom agents**
- Shared Quick Index across the entire account
- All users in the account share the same Quick Suite environment

```
AWS Account
    └── Quick Suite (single instance)
        ├── Quick Index (shared knowledge base)
        ├── Spaces
        │   ├── Personal Space (User A)
        │   ├── Personal Space (User B)
        │   ├── Team Space (Marketing)
        │   └── Team Space (Finance)
        ├── Custom Agents
        │   ├── Sales Agent
        │   ├── Compliance Agent
        │   └── HR Agent
        ├── Dashboards (Quick Sight)
        └── Workflows (Quick Flows/Automate)
```

**Amazon Q Business Architecture:**
- ✅ **Has "Application" instances**
- Multiple Q Business applications per AWS account
- Each application has its own index, data sources, and users
- Isolated environments for different use cases

```
AWS Account
    ├── Q Business Application: HR-Assistant
    │   ├── Index
    │   ├── Data Sources (Workday, HR docs)
    │   └── Users (HR team only)
    │
    ├── Q Business Application: Finance-Assistant
    │   ├── Index
    │   ├── Data Sources (ERP, financial docs)
    │   └── Users (Finance team only)
    │
    └── Q Business Application: Engineering-Docs
        ├── Index
        ├── Data Sources (GitHub, Confluence)
        └── Users (Engineering team)
```

**Key Implications:**

| Aspect | **Quick Suite** | **Amazon Q Business** |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Isolation** | Spaces provide soft boundaries | Applications provide hard boundaries |
| **Data Separation** | Shared Quick Index with permission controls | Separate indexes per application |
| **Billing** | Single $250/month infrastructure fee | Per-application infrastructure costs |
| **Management** | Manage one environment | Manage multiple applications |
| **Use Case** | Unified workspace for entire org | Separate apps for different departments |
| **Scaling** | Add users and spaces to same instance | Create new applications as needed |

**When This Matters:**

**Choose Quick Suite (account-level) if:**
- You want a unified workspace for the entire organization
- You prefer managing one environment
- You want shared knowledge across teams (with permissions)
- You want to minimize infrastructure costs

**Choose Q Business (application instances) if:**
- You need strict data isolation between departments
- Different teams have completely separate use cases
- You want independent management and configuration
- Compliance requires separate environments

    // Create index
    const index = new qbusiness.CfnIndex(this, 'Index', {
      applicationId: app.attrApplicationId,
      displayName: 'Main Index'
    });
    
    // Add data sources
    new qbusiness.CfnDataSource(this, 'S3Source', {
