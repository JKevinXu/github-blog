# 404 - Page Not Found

Sorry, but the page you were trying to view does not exist.

It might have been moved, deleted, or perhaps you mistyped the URL.

[Return to Home]({{ site.baseurl }}/)

<script>
  // JavaScript to track 404 errors in analytics (if you're using something like Google Analytics)
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    if (typeof ga === 'function') {
      ga('send', 'event', '404', 'page', window.location.pathname + window.location.search);
    }
  });
</script>
